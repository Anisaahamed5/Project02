# Project02
Website with Search Engine

## Name

Anisa Ahamed

## Description

This project allows a user to search for GIFS. They can input a subject and number of GIFS they want to see into the search bar. The website will then display the GIFS obtained through API.

## Functionality

The user is able to search for GIFS by using the search bars. After submitting the content in the search bars, the website displays a specific GIF subject and a specific number of GIFS.

## User Stories

1. A user wants to create a meme page and is looking for content with which to create memes.
2. A user wants to react to a funny text message. To do this, they search for an appropriate GIF.

## Technologies Used

HTML, CSS, jQuery, Flexbox

## Ideas for Future Improvement

1. Instead of using an API, I would use an SDK to have a greater variety of content.
2. I would improve the homepage and add preview GIFS to the index.html.
3. I would add more functionality to the other .html pages on the webpage.
